-   extract-domains-1 uses only the zcertificate to get the common name field from 
    the PEM format of Rapid 7 data this code is slow 

-   extract-domains-2 uses only the cryptographics libarary to get the command field from 
    the PEM format and this is very fast but it misses few of those domains which we get from the 
    zcertificate now the thing is these domains are not much too much 

-   extract-domains-3 uses hybrid approach first it uses the cryptographics library and then it uses the zcertificate  
    on those certificates which are failed by cryptographics in this we get the great balance between speed and more dataset 

I think extract-domains-3 is best and I have saved only the it's output which is processed/comman-names-3.csv

Now we have extracted all the domains in common-names-3.csv which is quite long and then we have extracted only .pk domains 
from it which is in pk-domains-rapid-7.csv
